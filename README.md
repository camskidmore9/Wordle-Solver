# Wordle-Solver
A script to help the user solve the popular game wordle in as few guesses as possible

This script works by having the user input the word they chose and then telling the results they got back from that word within the game. 

The script then compares the users input to a list of the most common 5 letter words in the English language and give the user a list of possiblities that match all given information.

Update 2/22:
The program still does not fully work and is having trouble taking words out that have letters already guessed that are not in the word. This is an issue in the loop and I will work on this next

Future Steps:
I plan to eventually write the script to automatically send requests to the wordle website and interpret the responses to auto-solve the word.
